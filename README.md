# NeedToKnow
NeedToKnow is a timer bar addon for the World of Warcraft user interface. 

NeedToKnow lets you track specific buffs, debuffs, and cooldowns as timer bars that always appear in the same place in the same color.

NeedToKnow is very useful for frequently used short-duration buffs and debuffs. For example, a rogue could configure NeedToKnow to show timer bars for Slice and Dice, Rupture, and their own stack of Deadly Poison VII. A death knight could use it to track their own diseases on a mob.
