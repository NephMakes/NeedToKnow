# NeedToKnow
Timer bar addon for World of Warcraft

NeedToKnow lets you track specific buffs, debuffs, totems, and cooldowns as timer bars that always appear in the same place in the same color.

NeedToKnow is very useful for frequently used short-duration buffs and debuffs. For example, a rogue could configure NeedToKnow to show timer bars for Slice and Dice, Rupture, and their own stack of Deadly Poison VII.  A death knight could use it to track their own diseases on a mob.  NeedToKnow also works with procs and on-use trinkets.  The number, size, position, and appearance of timer bars are all customizable.
