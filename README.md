# NeedToKnow

NeedToKnow is a timer bar addon for the World of Warcraft user interface. 

NeedToKnow lets you track specific buffs, debuffs, and cooldowns as timer bars that always appear in the same place in the same color.

NeedToKnow is very useful for frequently used short-duration buffs and debuffs. For example, a rogue could configure NeedToKnow to show timer bars for Slice & Dice and Rupture. A Death Knight could use it to track their diseases. 

### Features
* Easy to set up and customize. Easy on your computer. 
* Works with procs, on-use equipment, and totems
* Different setups for different specializations
* Track by SpellID
* Track more than one buff or debuff with one bar

### Other features
* Save setups for different specializations
* Track by name or spell ID
* Show cast time indicator to see when to refresh buffs and debuffs before they finish
* Make bars deplete at same rate to see which will finish first
* Blink bars when buff or debuff missing
* Track buffs on raid members without having to focus them


## Instructions

General options are available in the Blizzard interface options menu.  You can type "/needtoknow" or "/ntk" to lock/unlock the addon. To configure individual bars, right click them while unlocked. Bars work while locked. 

When entering your settings, be careful with your spelling and capitalization. Also remember that buffs and debuffs sometimes have different names than the items and abilities that apply them. The Death Knight ability Icy Touch, for example, applies a DoT called Frost Fever.
